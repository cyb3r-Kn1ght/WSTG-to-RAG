  - Input Validation

### Testing Approaches

#### Types of Testing
- **SQL Injection**
- **NoSQL Injection**
- **Client-side Injections**
- **Weak Cryptography**
- **Business Logic Testing**
- **Client-side Testing**
- **WebSocket Testing**
- **Web Messaging Testing**
- **Browser Storage Testing**
- **API Testing**
- **GraphQL Testing**

#### Testing Techniques
- **Manual Inspections**
  - Human reviews of security implications.
  - Assess policies, processes, and technical implementations.
  - **Advantages:**
    - No supporting technology needed
    - Versatile and flexible
    - Promotes teamwork
    - Early evaluation in SDLC
  - **Disadvantages:**
    - Time-consuming
    - Requires skilled personnel
- **Threat Modeling**
  - Identifying and mitigating security threats.
  - Steps:
    1. Decompose the application
    2. Define and classify assets
    3. Explore vulnerabilities
    4. Identify threats
    5. Create mitigation strategies

### Integration with Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- **Phased Approach:** From pre-development to maintenance and operations.
- **Security Tests:** Integrated into all SDLC phases.
- **SDLC Components:**
  - People
  - Process
  - Technology
- **Security Practices:**
  - Educate development and QA teams
  - Integrate security tests into CI/CD workflows
  - Automate security testing (DAST, SAST, SCA)

### Roles and Responsibilities
- **Developers:** Primary responsibility for application security; ensure secure coding practices.
- **Software Testers and QA:** Expand test cases to catch vulnerabilities early.
- **Security Specialists:** Verify application security alongside other techniques.
- **Project Managers:** Understand security issues and prioritize based on risks.

### Tools and Automation
- **Automated Security Analysis Tools:**
  - Limitations:
    - Generic detection
    - Inability to identify business logic flaws
  - Use strategically to investigate and verify issues.
- **Recommended Tools:**
  - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
  - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
  - Software Composition Analysis (SCA)

### Metrics and Reporting
- **Develop Metrics:**
  - Measure improvements in security programs.
  - Highlight needs for education and training.
  - Assess effectiveness of security measures.
- **Documentation:**
  - Transparent test results for stakeholders.
  - Use standardized report templates.
  - Convey material risks and technical insights.

### Best Practices
- **Holistic Security Testing:**
  - Address management and operational vulnerabilities.
  - Comprehensive testing beyond technical implementations.
- **Continuous Security:**
  - Security is an ongoing process.
  - Regularly update testing practices to address evolving threats.
- **Strategic Approach:**
  - Avoid reliance solely on automated tools.
  - Focus on unique application-specific vulnerabilities.

### Additional Resources
- **Suggested Reading:** For further learning on web security.
- **Testing Tools Resource:** Comprehensive list of recommended tools.
- **Fuzz Vectors and Encoded Injection Techniques:** For advanced testing scenarios.

### Notes
> **OWASP Goal:** Make insecure software the exception rather than the rule.

> **Security Testing Importance:** Critical for building secure applications; often neglected by organizations.

> **Guide's Purpose:** Provide a consistent and effective approach to security testing; free and open resource to foster understanding.

### Key Insights
- **Economic Impact:** In 2018, poor quality software cost the US approximately $2.84 trillion.
- **Vulnerability Management:** Time between discovery and exploitation is decreasing; timely patching is crucial.
- **Secure SDLC:** Integrate security throughout all phases to prevent vulnerabilities.
- **Documentation:** Accurate architecture and use case documentation are essential for robust security.

### Conclusion
- **Comprehensive Security:** Requires collaboration, continuous improvement, and integration into all aspects of development.
- **No Silver Bullet:** Effective security relies on a combination of tools, practices, and expert knowledge.
