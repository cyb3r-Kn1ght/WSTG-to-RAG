## OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (Version 4.2)

### Overview
- **Version:** 4.2
- **Purpose:** Provide a comprehensive framework and methodologies for testing web application security within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

### Contents
- **Principles of Testing**
- **Threat Modeling**
- **Penetration Testing**
- **Web Application Security Testing**
- **Testing Techniques and Methodologies**
- **Reporting and Metrics**
- **Testing Tools and Resources**
- **Further Reading**

### Foundations
- **OWASP Testing Project:** Serves as the foundation for various web security testing principles and methodologies.
- **Phased Approach:** Emphasizes testing during different SDLC stages:
  1. Before Development Begins
  2. During Definition and Design
  3. During Development
  4. During Deployment
  5. During Maintenance and Operations

### Web Application Security Testing
- **Information Gathering:**
  - Conduct reconnaissance and fingerprinting of web servers and applications.
  - Review old backups and unreferenced files for sensitive information.
  - Enumerate infrastructure and application admin interfaces.
- **Specific Tests:**
  - **HTTP Methods:** ```4.2.6 Test HTTP Methods```
  - **HTTP Strict Transport Security:** ```4.2.7 Test HTTP Strict Transport Security```
  - RIA cross-domain policy
  - File permissions

### Identity and Access Management Testing
- **Identity Management:**
  - Role definitions
  - User registration
  - Account provisioning and enumeration
  - Username policy
- **Authentication Testing:**
  - Credentials transport
  - Default credentials
  - Lockout mechanisms
  - Bypassing authentication
  - Remember password vulnerabilities
  - Browser cache weaknesses
  - Password policies and resets
- **Authorization Testing:**
  - Directory traversal
  - Bypassing authorization
  - Privilege escalation
  - Insecure direct object references

### Session Management Testing
- **Areas Covered:**
  - Session schema
  - Cookie attributes
  - Session fixation
  - Exposed session variables
  - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Logout functionality
  - Session timeout and puzzling
  - Session hijacking

### Input Validation Testing
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - Reflected and stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
  - HTTP verb tampering
  - HTTP parameter pollution
  - SQL Injection (Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server)

### Testing Approaches
- **Manual Inspections:**
  - Human reviews of security implications of policies and processes.
  - Assess technology decisions via documentation and interviews.
- **Threat Modeling:**
  - Identify security threats and develop mitigation strategies.
  - Steps: Decompose application, define assets, explore vulnerabilities, identify threats, create mitigation strategies.
  - **STRIDE:** Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege
- **Source Code Review:**
  - Manual checking for security issues.
  - Identifies concurrency problems, flawed business logic, access control issues.
- **Penetration Testing:**
  - Ethical hacking to find and exploit vulnerabilities without prior knowledge of the system.
  - Complements other testing methods; not solely sufficient.

### Security Testing in SDLC
- **Integration:** Security testing should be integrated into all phases of the SDLC.
- **Education:** Educate development and QA teams on common security issues.
- **Automation:**
  - **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**
  - **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**
  - **Software Composition Analysis (SCA)**
- **Continuous Testing:** Incorporate security tests into CI/CD workflows.

### Security Requirements and Compliance
- **Definition:** Derived from standards, policies, and regulations.
- **Examples:**
  - **FFIEC:** Mitigate weak authentication risks.
  - **PCI DSS:** Protect sensitive data with encryption.
- **Validation:** Use security testing to validate requirements.

### Reporting and Metrics
- **Documentation:**
  - Use standardized templates for consistency.
  - Include severity ratings (e.g., CVSS) and remediation guidance.
- **Metrics:**
  - Measure vulnerabilities found, risk reduction, and compliance.
  - Support decision-making for risk acceptance, mitigation, or transfer.
- **Stakeholders:**
  - Developers, Project Managers, Information Security Officers, Auditors, CIOs.

### Best Practices
- **Holistic Approach:** Combine manual reviews, technical testing, and automated tools.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Keep the testing guide updated to address evolving threats.
- **Collaboration:** Work with security experts to develop comprehensive testing practices.
- **Secure Coding Standards:** Enforce standards like the Java Secure Coding Standard.

### Tools and Resources
- **Threat Modeling Tools:** Threat trees, attack libraries.
- **Testing Tools:** Automated scanners, source code analysis tools.
- **Resources:** Suggested reading and fuzz vectors for testing.

### Important Notes
> **Security testing alone cannot measure the overall security of an application due to the infinite number of attack vectors.**

### Conclusion
- **OWASP Goal:** Make insecure software the exception rather than the rule.
- **Continuous Process:** Security is ongoing and requires a strategic, holistic approach.
- **Developer Responsibility:** Developers are primarily responsible for application security through secure coding practices.
