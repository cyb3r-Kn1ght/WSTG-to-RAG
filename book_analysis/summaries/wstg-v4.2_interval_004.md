## Introduction

The **OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) version 4.2** provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the security of web applications throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It aims to make insecure software the exception rather than the rule by offering consistent and effective security testing methodologies.

> **Note:** The guide is a free and open resource, fostering widespread understanding of security testing techniques.

## Phased Approach to Testing

WSTG emphasizes integrating security testing into various stages of the SDLC:

1. **Before Development Begins**
2. **During Definition and Design**
3. **During Development**
4. **During Deployment**
5. **During Maintenance and Operations**

### Typical SDLC Testing Workflow

- Incorporate security tests to assess control effectiveness.
- Focus on people, processes, and technology.
- Use metrics to measure security program improvements.

## Web Application Security Testing

### Information Gathering

- **Techniques:**
  - Search Engine Discovery
  - Web Server and Application Fingerprinting
  - Reviewing Metadata
- **Tools:**
  - `curl`, `wget`, Burp Suite, ZAP
- **Search Operators:**
  - `site:`, `inurl:`, `intitle:`, `filetype:`, etc.

### Code Review and Analysis

- **Methods:**
  - Manual Code Reviews
  - Source Code Analysis
- **Common Issues:**
  - Concurrency Problems
  - Flawed Business Logic
  - Access Control Issues

### Penetration Testing

- **Overview:**
  - Also known as Black-Box Testing or Ethical Hacking
  - Simulates attacker behavior to find vulnerabilities
- **Methodologies:**
  - Pre-engagement Interactions
  - Intelligence Gathering
  - Threat Modeling
  - Vulnerability Analysis
  - Exploitation
  - Post Exploitation
  - Reporting

## Testing Methodologies

### Manual Inspections

- **Advantages:**
  - No supporting technology needed
  - Versatility and flexibility
  - Promotes teamwork
  - Early evaluation in the SDLC
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Time-consuming
  - Requires skilled personnel

### Threat Modeling

- **Steps:**
  1. Decompose the application
  2. Define and classify assets
  3. Explore vulnerabilities
  4. Identify threats
  5. Create mitigation strategies
- **Benefits:**
  - Provides a practical attacker view
  - Flexible and applicable early in SDLC

### Source Code Review

- **Benefits:**
  - Identifies implementation issues accurately
  - Efficient for input validation failures
- **Limitations:**
  - May miss issues in compiled libraries
  - Cannot easily detect runtime errors

## Tools and Resources

### Automated Scanning Tools

- **Netcraft:** Scans websites and gathers server information
- **Nikto:** Open-source command-line scanning tool
- **Nmap:** Network scanning tool with GUI (Zenmap)

### Security Testing Tools

- **Burp Suite**
- **OWASP ZAP**
- **Attack Surface Detector (ASD)**
  ```code
  java -jar attack-surface-detector-cli-1.3.5.jar <source-code-path> [flags]
  ```

### Additional Tools

- Browser Inspect Tools
- `curl`
- `wget`
- Waybackurls
- Google Maps API Scanner

## Reporting Methodology

- **Documentation:**
  - Use standardized report templates
  - Include tables for clarity

| ID | Name  |
|----|-------|
| 1  | Mary  |
| 2  | Peter |
| 3  | Joe    |

- **Content:**
  - Categorize vulnerabilities
  - Provide severity ratings using CVSS
  - Offer remediation guidance

- **Goals:**
  - Convey material risks to business owners
  - Offer technical insights for developers

> **Note:** Reports should highlight the root cause of security issues and provide actionable remediation steps.

## Security Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Driven by standards, policies, and regulations
- **Examples:**
  - Account lockout after failed logins
  - Minimum password complexity

### Risk-Driven Requirements

- Focus on preventing unauthorized actions
- **Examples:**
  - Preventing unauthorized financial transactions
  - Data destruction prevention

### Deriving Security Requirements

- **From Use Cases:**
  - Identify critical use and misuse scenarios
- **Step-by-Step:**
  1. Describe functional scenarios
  2. Identify negative scenarios
  3. Derive countermeasures

## Security Testing in SDLC

### Development Phase

- **Activities:**
  - Secure code reviews
  - Static and dynamic analysis
  - Security unit tests

### Integration Phase

- **Methods:**
  - White-box Testing (Source Code Analysis)
  - Black-box Testing (Penetration Testing)
  - Gray-box Testing (Partial Knowledge)

### Deployment and Maintenance

- **Tasks:**
  - Operational Management Reviews
  - Periodic Health Checks
  - Change Verification

## Metrics and Measurement

### Security Test Metrics

- **Types:**
  - Absolute (e.g., number of vulnerabilities)
  - Comparative (e.g., comparing different testing methods)
- **Goals:**
  - Reduce vulnerabilities before deployment
  - Assess security process quality

### Key Metrics

- Vulnerability reduction
- Risk ratings
- Compliance adherence

> **Note:** Metrics help in risk analysis and management processes, guiding business decisions on risk acceptance and mitigation.

## Conclusion

The **OWASP Web Security Testing Guide v4.2** provides a holistic and phased approach to web application security testing. By integrating various testing methodologies, leveraging appropriate tools, and adhering to defined security requirements, organizations can effectively identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, ensuring robust application security throughout the SDLC.
