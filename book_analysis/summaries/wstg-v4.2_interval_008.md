## Introduction

The **Web Security Testing Guide v4.2** provides a comprehensive framework for testing the security of web applications. It emphasizes the importance of integrating security testing throughout the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** to ensure robust application security.

> **Note:** OWASP aims to make insecure software the exception rather than the rule.

### Objectives

- Provide a consistent and effective approach to security testing.
- Foster collaboration among security experts.
- Offer a free and open resource for widespread understanding of security testing techniques.

## Phased Approach to Testing

Security testing is integrated into different stages of the SDLC:

1. **Before Development Begins**
2. **During Definition and Design**
3. **During Development**
4. **During Deployment**
5. **During Maintenance and Operations**

### Typical SDLC Testing Workflow

## Testing Methodologies

### Manual Inspections

- **Human Reviews:** Assess security implications of people, policies, and processes.
- **Technology Reviews:** Examine architectural designs through documentation and interviews.
  
**Advantages:**
- No need for supporting technology
- Promotes teamwork and flexibility

**Disadvantages:**
- Time-consuming
- Requires skilled individuals

### Threat Modeling

- **Purpose:** Identify security threats and develop mitigation strategies.
- **Steps:**
  1. Decompose the application
  2. Define and classify assets
  3. Explore vulnerabilities
  4. Identify threats
  5. Create mitigation strategies

### Source Code Review

- **Purpose:** Manually check source code for security issues.
- **Common Issues:**
  - Concurrency problems
  - Flawed business logic
  - Access control issues

### Penetration Testing

- **Also Known As:** Black-box testing, ethical hacking.
- **Objective:** Find security vulnerabilities without prior knowledge of the application.
  
```code
$ncat www.example.com 80 
DELETE /resource.html HTTP/1.1 
Host: www.example.com 
X-HTTP-Method: DELETE
```

**Tools:**
- Nikto
- Nmap
- Burp Suite

  - Ensure proper verification mechanisms

## Authentication Testing

### Key Areas

1. **Credentials Transport:**
   - Ensure credentials are encrypted (use HTTPS)
   
2. **Default Credentials:**
   - Test for unchanged default usernames and passwords
   
3. **Lockout Mechanisms:**
   - Verify account lockout after multiple failed attempts
   
4. **Bypassing Authentication:**
   - Attempt to skip login pages or manipulate parameters
   
5. **Remember Password Functionality:**
   - Test for vulnerabilities in "Remember Me" features
   
6. **Browser Cache Weaknesses:**
   - Ensure sensitive data is not stored in the browser cache
   
7. **Password Policies:**
   - Enforce strong password requirements
   
8. **Security Questions:**
   - Test for weak or easily guessable security questions
   
9. **Password Resets:**
   - Verify secure password reset mechanisms
   
10. **Alternative Authentication Channels:**
    - Assess security of alternative authentication methods

### Testing Methods

- **Capture Traffic:**
  - Use tools like OWASP ZAP or Wireshark
  
- **Force Protocol Switching:**
  - Attempt to switch from HTTPS to HTTP
   
- **Session Management:**
  - Check Secure and HttpOnly attributes on cookies

**Sample Code for HSTS:**
```code
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

## Authorization Testing

### Objectives
