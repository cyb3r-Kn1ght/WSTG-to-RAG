## Web Security Testing Guide v4.2

The **Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) version 4.2** provides a comprehensive framework for assessing the security of web applications. It covers various testing principles, methodologies, and specific vulnerability assessments integrated into the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

### Introduction

- **Purpose:** Enhance understanding of web application security through a detailed testing framework.
- **Importance:** Security testing is critical but often neglected; aims to make insecure software the exception.
- **Economics:** In 2018, poor quality software cost the US approximately $2.84 trillion.

### Testing Principles

- **Phased Approach:** Integrates security testing at all SDLC stages from before development to maintenance.
- **OWASP Foundation:** Utilizes OWASP Testing Project principles and methodologies.
- **Collaboration:** Emphasizes expert collaboration and continuous updates to address evolving threats.

> **Note:** Security testing cannot cover all potential attack vectors; a strategic, holistic approach is essential.

### Testing Methodologies

#### Manual Testing

- **Inspections:** Human reviews assessing security implications of people, policies, and processes.
- **Advantages:** No technology needed, promotes teamwork, early SDLC evaluation.
- **Disadvantages:** Time-consuming, requires skilled personnel.

#### Automated Testing

- **Tools:** Nessus, Nikto, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.
- **Limitations:** May miss unique issues in custom code, false positives/negatives.

#### Threat Modeling

- **Purpose:** Identify and mitigate security threats during the design phase.
- **Steps:** Decompose application, define assets, explore vulnerabilities, identify threats, create mitigation strategies.
- **Tools:** Threat trees, attack libraries.

### Specific Testing Areas

#### Information Gathering

- **Techniques:** Search Engine Discovery, Web Server Fingerprinting, Reviewing Metadata.
- **Tools:** Netcraft, Shodan, Google Dorks, curl.
- **Objectives:** Identify entry points, map application architecture, discover sensitive information.

#### Configuration and Deployment Management Testing

- **Focus:** Security of network infrastructure and application platforms.
- **Tests Include:** Enumerating admin interfaces, testing HTTP methods, validating HSTS, file permissions.
- **Tools:** Nmap, telnet, curl.

#### Identity Management Testing

- **Areas:** Role definitions, user registration, account provisioning, account enumeration, username policies.
- **Methods:** Reviewing documentation, consulting developers, fuzzy testing roles.
- **Tools:** Burp’s Autorize, ZAP’s Access Control Testing.

#### Authentication Testing

- **Focus Areas:**
  - **Credential Transport:** Ensure encryption (HTTPS) during transmission.
  - **Default Credentials:** Test for unchanged default passwords.
  - **Lockout Mechanisms:** Validate protection against brute force attacks.
  - **Bypassing Authentication:** Test for authentication schema bypass methods.
  - **Password Policies:** Enforce strong password requirements.
  - **Security Questions:** Assess strength and guessability.
- **Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Hydra.

#### Authorization Testing

- **Objectives:**
  - **Directory Traversal:** Prevent unauthorized file access.
  - **Privilege Escalation:** Ensure users cannot gain higher privileges.
  - **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** Verify access controls on object references.
- **Techniques:** Parameter manipulation, session hijacking.
- **Tools:** Burp Suite, ZAP.

#### Session Management Testing

- **Focus Areas:**
  - **Session Schema:** Assess structure and security of session data.
  - **Cookie Attributes:** Ensure Secure and HttpOnly flags are set.
  - **Session Fixation:** Prevent hijacking by renewing session IDs post-authentication.
  - **CSRF Protection:** Validate tokens and request integrity.
  - **Session Timeout:** Ensure automatic session termination after inactivity.
- **Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, JHijack.

#### Input Validation Testing

- **Vulnerabilities:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP).
- **Techniques:** 
  - **XSS:** Inject scripts to steal cookies or perform actions.
  - **SQL Injection:** Manipulate queries to access or modify database.
  - **HPP:** Send duplicate parameters to bypass security filters.
- **Tools:** SQLMap, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.

### Vulnerability Specific Testing

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Types:** Reflected, Stored, DOM-based.
- **Testing Techniques:** Input manipulation, payload injection, filter bypassing.
- **Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, XSS-Proxy.
- **Prevention:** Proper encoding, input sanitization, using Content Security Policy (CSP).

#### SQL Injection

- **Types:** Inband, Out-of-band, Inferential (Blind).
- **Testing Techniques:** Error-based, Union-based, Boolean-based, Time-based.
- **Tools:** SQLMap, wfuzz, sqlbftools.
- **Prevention:** Use prepared statements, ORM frameworks, input validation.

#### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

- **Description:** Forcing authenticated users to perform unintended actions.
- **Testing Techniques:** Crafting malicious forms or links, verifying token effectiveness.
- **Tools:** CSRF Tester, OWASP ZAP.
- **Prevention:** Use anti-CSRF tokens, same-site cookies, user action confirmations.

### Testing Tools and Resources

- **Browser Tools:** Inspect Element, Developer Tools.
- **Proxy Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Tamper Data.
- **Fuzzers:** DirBuster, DotDotPwn, wfuzz.
- **OSINT Tools:** theHarvester, Sublist3r, OWASP Amass.
- **Specialized Tools:** WhatWeb, Wappalyzer, WebGoat.

### Reporting and Metrics

- **Methodology:** Use standardized templates, categorize vulnerabilities by severity, provide remediation guidance.
- **Metrics:** Number of vulnerabilities found, types of vulnerabilities, improvement over time.
- **Stakeholders:** Developers, QA testers, security specialists, project managers, auditors, CIOs.

> **Note:** Reports should clearly communicate risks to business owners and technical details to developers.

### Best Practices

- **Integrate Security Early:** Embed security testing in all SDLC phases.
- **Use Strong Metrics:** Measure and track security improvements.
- **Maintain Documentation:** Keep detailed records of test cases, vulnerabilities, and remediation steps.
- **Educate Teams:** Train developers and QA on common security issues and secure coding practices.
- **Automate Where Possible:** Utilize automated tools for routine checks but complement with manual testing for comprehensive coverage.

### Conclusion

The **OWASP Web Security Testing Guide v4.2** is an essential resource for developing a robust security testing program. By following its methodologies, leveraging appropriate tools, and maintaining a continuous improvement mindset, organizations can significantly enhance the security posture of their web applications.
