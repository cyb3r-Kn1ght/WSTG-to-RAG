## Web Security Testing Guide v4.2

OWASP's Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG) version 4.2 provides a comprehensive framework for testing the security of web applications throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). This guide emphasizes a phased approach, integrating security testing from initial development stages to maintenance and operations.

### Introduction and Objectives

- **Purpose**: Enhance understanding and provide methodologies for effective web application security testing.
- **Importance**: 
  - Web applications are exposed to millions of users, necessitating robust security measures.
  - Security testing is critical but often neglected, leading to vulnerabilities.
- **Goals**:
  - Make insecure software the exception.
  - Offer consistent and effective security testing approaches.
  - Foster collaboration among security experts.
- **Economic Impact**:
  - Insecure software can result in significant financial losses (e.g., $2.84 trillion in the US as of 2018).

### Testing Methodologies

#### Manual Inspections
- **Description**: Human reviews assessing security implications of people, policies, and processes.
- **Advantages**:
  - No technology needed.
  - Promotes teamwork and flexibility.
  - Early evaluation in SDLC.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Time-consuming.
  - Requires skilled personnel.

#### Threat Modeling
- **Purpose**: Identify security threats and develop mitigation strategies during the design phase.
- **Steps**:
  1. Decompose the application.
  2. Define and classify assets.
  3. Explore vulnerabilities.
  4. Identify threats.
  5. Create mitigation strategies.
- **Advantages**:
  - Practical attacker perspective.
  - Flexible and can be applied early in SDLC.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Good models do not guarantee secure software.

#### Code Review
- **Purpose**: Manually check source code for security issues.
- **Benefits**:
  - Identifies vulnerabilities not detectable through black-box testing.
  - Understands code operations and security flaws accurately.
- **Challenges**:
  - May miss issues in compiled libraries and runtime errors.

#### Penetration Testing
- **Also Known As**: Black-box testing, ethical hacking.
- **Objective**: Find and exploit vulnerabilities without prior knowledge of the application's internals.
- **Tools**: Automated scanners (e.g., Burp Suite, ZAP), manual testing techniques.
- **Limitations**:
  - May identify only a subset of potential vulnerabilities.
  - Often conducted post-deployment, which is less effective.

### Phased Approach in SDLC

1. **Before Development Begins**
   - Define security requirements.
   - Establish metrics and benchmarks.
2. **During Definition and Design**
   - Conduct threat modeling.
   - Ensure secure architectural designs.
3. **During Development**
   - Perform secure code reviews.
   - Implement static and dynamic analysis.
4. **During Deployment**
   - Test configuration and deployment settings.
   - Validate security controls.
5. **During Maintenance and Operations**
   - Perform periodic health checks.
   - Monitor and update security measures.

### Detailed Testing Areas

#### Web Application Security Testing
- **Information Gathering**
  - Techniques: Reconnaissance, fingerprinting, reviewing metadata.
  - Tools: Search engines, Shodan, dnsrecon.
- **Configuration and Deployment Management Testing**
  - Assess server configurations, HTTP methods, HSTS, cross-domain policies.
  - Tools: Nmap, Nikto.
- **Identity Management Testing**
  - Role definitions, user registration, account provisioning.
  - Checks for account enumeration and username policies.
- **Authentication Testing**
  - Secure credential transport, default credentials, lockout mechanisms.
  - Ensure strong password policies and secure password resets.
- **Authorization Testing**
  - Verify access controls, directory traversal, privilege escalation.
  - Test for insecure direct object references.
- **Session Management Testing**
  - Assess session schemas, cookie attributes, session fixation.
  - Test for CSRF, session timeout, and session hijacking.
- **Input Validation Testing**
  - Check for XSS, SQL injection, HTTP verb tampering.
  - Validate against OWASP Top Ten vulnerabilities.
- **Cryptography Testing**
  - Ensure strong encryption standards and proper implementation.
- **Business Logic Testing**
  - Validate data integrity, prevent request forging.
- **Client-side Testing**
  - Assess DOM manipulation, XSS, Clickjacking vulnerabilities.
- **API Testing**
  - Test RESTful and GraphQL APIs for security flaws.
- **Reporting Methodology**
  - Document findings with severity ratings and remediation steps.
- **Testing Tools Resource**
  - Utilize tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nmap, SQLMap.

### Specific Vulnerabilities and Testing Techniques

#### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Types**:
  - Reflected XSS: Executed via crafted URLs.
  - Stored XSS: Stored in the database and executed on page load.
- **Testing**:
  - Inject scripts into input fields and observe execution.
  - Use tools like BeEF and OWASP ZAP for automated testing.
- **Prevention**:
  - Proper input sanitization and encoding.
  - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).

#### SQL Injection
- **Description**: Manipulate SQL queries through unsanitized input.
- **Types**:
  - Inband, Out-of-band, Inferential (Blind).
- **Testing**:
  - Inject SQL payloads and analyze responses.
  - Use tools like SQLMap for automation.
- **Prevention**:
  - Use prepared statements and parameterized queries.
  - Implement ORM frameworks with security best practices.

#### HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)
- **Description**: Manipulate HTTP parameters to bypass security controls.
- **Testing**:
  - Send multiple parameters with the same name.
  - Analyze application response for handling duplicates.
- **Prevention**:
  - Validate and sanitize all input parameters.
  - Limit the number of allowed parameters.

### Tools and Techniques

- **Automated Scanners**: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nikto, SQLMap.
- **Proxy Tools**: Burp Proxy, OWASP ZAP.
- **Fingerprinting Tools**: WhatWeb, Wappalyzer.
- **Enumeration Tools**: Nmap, dnsrecon, Sublist3r.
- **Code Analysis Tools**: Static analysis tools integrated into development environments.
- **Other Tools**: THC-HYDRA for brute force attacks, DirBuster for directory enumeration.

### Reporting and Metrics

- **Documentation**:
  - Use standardized templates for consistency.
  - Include technical details and business impact.
- **Metrics**:
  - Number of vulnerabilities found and fixed.
  - Severity distribution of vulnerabilities.
  - Time taken to remediate issues.
- **Stakeholders**:
  - Developers: Insights for secure coding.
  - Project Managers: Track security milestones.
  - Security Officers: Compliance and risk management.
  - Auditors: Evidence of security controls.

### Remediation Practices

- **Patch Management**: Regularly update and patch software components.
- **Configuration Management**: Secure server configurations, minimize attack surface.
- **Code Improvements**: Implement secure coding practices, use libraries for sanitization.
- **Access Controls**: Enforce least privilege, use strong authentication mechanisms.
- **Session Security**: Use secure, HTTPOnly cookies, implement session timeouts.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct periodic security reviews and assessments.

### Best Practices

- **Integrate Security into SDLC**: Ensure security is part of every development phase.
- **Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enhance authentication security.
- **Educate Teams**: Train developers and QA on security best practices.
- **Automate Where Possible**: Use automated tools for repetitive tasks but validate results manually.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement ongoing surveillance to detect and respond to threats promptly.

> **Note**: Security is an ongoing process. Regular updates to the testing guide and methodologies are essential to address evolving threats.
