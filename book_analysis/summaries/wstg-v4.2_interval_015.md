# Web Security Testing Guide v4.2 Summary

## Introduction

The **Web Security Testing Guide v4.2** provides comprehensive methodologies and best practices for assessing the security of web applications. It emphasizes integrating security testing throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) to build secure applications and mitigate vulnerabilities effectively.

> **Note:** Security testing alone cannot measure overall application security due to the infinite number of attack vectors. A holistic approach involving manual reviews, technical testing, and continuous monitoring is essential.

## Testing Principles and Methodologies

### Principles of Testing

- Importance of measuring and integrating security into all SDLC phases.
- Collaboration among experts to develop comprehensive security practices.
- Tailoring the guide to fit an organization's specific technologies and processes.

### Threat Modeling

- Identifying and prioritizing potential threats.
- Decomposing the application and defining assets.
- Developing mitigation strategies using frameworks like STRIDE.

### Code Review

- Manual and automated source code analysis.
- Identifying concurrency issues, flawed business logic, and access control problems.
- Tools: Static analysis tools, custom scripts.

### Penetration Testing

- Simulating attacker behavior to identify vulnerabilities.
- Techniques vary based on application type and complexity.
- Tools: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, SQLMap.

### Business Logic Testing

- Assessing data validation, request forging, and integrity checks.
- Ensuring workflows adhere to security policies.

## Phased Approach to Testing

1. **Before Development Begins**
   - Define security requirements and standards.
   - Establish measurement and metrics criteria.

2. **During Definition and Design**
   - Conduct threat modeling.
   - Review architecture for security flaws.

3. **During Development**
   - Perform secure code reviews.
   - Implement static and dynamic analysis.

4. **During Deployment**
   - Validate server and application configurations.
   - Ensure secure deployment practices.

5. **During Maintenance and Operations**
   - Conduct periodic health checks.
   - Monitor for new vulnerabilities and perform change verification.

## Web Application Security Testing

### Information Gathering

  - Identify infrastructure elements.
  - Review for known vulnerabilities.
  - Assess administrative tools and authentication systems.

- **Common Vulnerabilities:**
  - Exposed server information
  - Weak file permissions
  - Misconfigured HTTP methods

### Identity Management Testing

- **Tests Include:**
  - Role Definitions
  - User Registration Processes
  - Account Provisioning and Enumeration
  - Username Policy Enforcement

### Authentication Testing

- **Areas to Test:**
  - Credentials Transport (e.g., HTTPS enforcement)
  - Default Credentials
  - Lockout Mechanisms
  - Authentication Bypass
  - Remember Password Functionality
  - Browser Cache Weaknesses
  - Password Policies and Resets

### Authorization Testing

- **Focus Areas:**
  - Directory Traversal
  - Bypassing Authorization Schemas
  - Privilege Escalation
  - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

### Session Management Testing

- **Key Aspects:**
  - Session Schema
  - Cookie Attributes (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`)
  - Session Fixation
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Logout Functionality
  - Session Timeout and Puzzling
  - Session Hijacking

### Input Validation Testing

- **Vulnerabilities to Test:**
  - Reflected and Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
  - SQL Injection (Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server)
  - HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)
  - LDAP Injection
  - XML Injection (XXE)
  - XPath Injection

## Specific Vulnerabilities and Testing Techniques

### SQL Injection

- **Types:**
  - In-band
  - Out-of-band
  - Inferential (Blind)

- **Techniques:**
  - Union-Based
  - Boolean-Based
  - Time-Based

- **Tools:**
  - SQLMap, sqlbftools, MySqloit

- **Example Payloads:**
  ```sql
  SELECT id, name FROM users WHERE id=1 UNION SELECT 1, version() limit 1, 1
  ```

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- **Types:**
  - Reflected
  - Stored
  - DOM-Based

- **Techniques:**
  - Script Injection
  - HTML Attribute Manipulation
  - Using Encoded Payloads

- **Tools:**
  - Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, BeEF

- **Example Payload:**
  ```html
  <script>alert('XSS')</script>
  ```

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

- **Testing Steps:**
  - Identify vulnerable forms and actions.
  - Craft malicious requests that execute unintended actions.
  - Verify if tokens or other protection mechanisms are in place.

- **Example Attack:**
  ```html
  <form action="https://target.com/delete" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="rule" value="*">
    <input type="submit" value="Attack">
  </form>
  ```

### XML Injection and XXE

- **Testing Objectives:**
  - Identify injection points in XML inputs.
  - Manipulate XML structure to execute external entities.
  - Assess impact of malformed XML.

- **Example Payload:**
  ```xml
  <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ELEMENT foo ANY > <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" > ]>
  <foo>&xxe;</foo>
  ```

### HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)

- **Techniques:**
  - Sending multiple parameters with the same name.
  - Analyzing server response for handling dupes.

- **Example Payload:**
  ```
  http://www.example.com/page?param=1&param=2
  ```
