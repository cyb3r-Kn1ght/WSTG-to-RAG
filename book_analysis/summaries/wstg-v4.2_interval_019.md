## Web Security Testing Guide v4.2

### Introduction

> **OWASP aims to make insecure software the exception rather than the rule.**  
> **Testing is a critical part of building secure applications, yet many organizations neglect it.**

The **OWASP Testing Project** provides a foundation for various web security testing principles and methodologies, emphasizing a consistent and effective approach integrated within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

### Phased Approach to Testing

**Phases of Web Security Testing:**
1. Before Development Begins
2. During Definition and Design
3. During Development
4. During Deployment
5. During Maintenance and Operations

**Typical SDLC Testing Workflow:**
*Aligned with various development methodologies, including Agile, Waterfall, etc.*

### Web Application Security Testing

#### Information Gathering

- **Techniques:**
  - Search Engine Discovery
  - Fingerprinting web servers and applications
  - Reviewing metadata for potential information leakage
  - Enumerating application entry points

- **Tools:**
  - `curl`, `wget`
  - Search engines like Google, Bing, Shodan
  - **Search Operators:** `site:`, `inurl:`, `intitle:`, `filetype:`

```code
$ curl -O -Ss http://www.google.com/robots.txt && head -n5 robots.txt 
```

#### Configuration and Deployment Management Testing

- **Key Tests:**
  - Enumerate admin interfaces
  - Test HTTP methods
  - Ensure proper configuration of HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
  - Test file permissions

- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - Exposed server information
  - Improper file permissions
  - Subdomain takeover

#### Identity Management Testing

- **Tests Include:**
  - Role definitions
  - User registration process
  - Account provisioning
  - Account enumeration
  - Username policy enforcement

- **Tools:**
  - Burp’s Autorize extension
  - ZAP’s Access Control Testing add-on

#### Authentication Testing

- **Areas to Test:**
  - Credentials transport over encrypted channels
  - Default credentials
  - Lockout mechanisms
  - Bypassing authentication
  - Remember password functionalities
  - Browser cache weaknesses
  - Password policies
  - Security questions and password resets

```code
Select active users:
<!-- Query: SELECT id, name FROM app.users WHERE active='1' -->
```

#### Authorization Testing

- **Focus Areas:**
  - Directory traversal
  - Bypassing authorization schemas
  - Privilege escalation
  - Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

#### Session Management Testing

- **Key Aspects:**
  - Session schema analysis
  - Cookie attributes (`Secure`, `HttpOnly`)
  - Session fixation
  - Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  - Logout functionality
  - Session timeout
  - Session puzzling
  - Session hijacking

#### Input Validation Testing

- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
  - SQL injection for various databases
  - HTTP parameter pollution

### Testing Methodologies for Specific Vulnerabilities

- **SQL Injection**
  - Techniques: Inband, Out-of-band, Inferential (Blind)
  - Tools: SQLMap, Burp Suite
  - **Best Practices:**
    - Use prepared statements
    - Validate and sanitize inputs

- **NoSQL Injection**
  - Focus on: JSON APIs
  - **Tools:** Custom scripts, Burp Suite

- **Cross-site Scripting (XSS)**
  - Types: Reflected, Stored, DOM-based
  - **Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
  - **Prevention:**
    - Proper encoding
    - Content Security Policy (CSP)

### Weak Cryptography Testing

- **Areas to Assess:**
  - Transport Layer Security (TLS) configurations
  - Cryptographic strength evaluations
  - Padding Oracle vulnerabilities

- **Recommendations:**
  - Use strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256)
  - Implement HTTPS with HSTS
  - Avoid deprecated protocols and ciphers (e.g., SSLv3, RC4)

### Business Logic Testing

- **Test Objectives:**
  - Data validation
  - Request forging
  - Integrity checks
  - Process timing
  - Function limits

- **Challenges:**
  - Requires manual testing
  - Not detectable by automated tools

### Reporting and Documentation

- **Methodology:**
  - Use standardized report templates
  - Categorize vulnerabilities by severity using CVSS
  - Provide remediation guidance for developers

- **Metrics:**
  - Total vulnerabilities found
  - Comparison against baselines
  - Risk assessments based on vulnerability impact

### Tools and Resources

- **Testing Tools:**
  - **Proxies:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
  - **Scanners:** Nessus, Nikto, sqlmap
  - **Enumeration:** Nmap, Sublist3r
  - **Other Tools:** Fiddler, Wireshark, DirBuster

- **Resources:**
  - OWASP Cheat Sheets
  - OWASP Proactive Controls
  - Relevant RFCs and whitepapers

### Key Points

- **Security is a Continuous Process:**  
  > Maintain and regularly update security practices to address evolving threats.

- **Manual Testing is Crucial:**  
  > Especially for business logic and complex vulnerabilities not handled by automated tools.

- **Collaboration Enhances Security:**  
  > Working with developers and stakeholders ensures comprehensive understanding and coverage.

- **Secure Coding Practices:**  
  > Developers are primarily responsible for application security through robust coding practices.

### Conclusion

Implementing a thorough and phased approach to web security testing, leveraging both manual and automated methodologies, is essential for securing web applications. Utilizing the OWASP Testing Guide v4.2 as a framework ensures that testing covers a wide range of vulnerabilities and integrates seamlessly within the SDLC, ultimately fostering the development of secure and resilient applications.
