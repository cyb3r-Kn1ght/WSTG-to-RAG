## Introduction & Overview

The **Web Security Testing Guide v4.2** is a comprehensive resource outlining methodologies and best practices for testing the security of web applications. It emphasizes the importance of integrating security testing throughout the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** to mitigate vulnerabilities effectively.

> **Note:** OWASP aims to make insecure software the exception rather than the rule through consistent and effective security testing approaches.

## Testing Methodologies

### Manual Testing
- **Manual Inspections:** Human reviews assessing security implications of people, policies, and processes.
- **Threat Modeling:** Identifying security threats and developing mitigation strategies.
- **Code Review:** Manually checking source code for security issues.
- **Penetration Testing:** Simulating attacks to find and exploit vulnerabilities.

### Automated Testing
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Scanning applications in runtime.
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Analyzing source code for vulnerabilities.
- **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Identifying vulnerabilities in third-party components.

## Phased Approach in SDLC

Web security testing should be integrated across all SDLC phases:
1. **Before Development Begins**
2. **During Definition and Design**
3. **During Development**
4. **During Deployment**
5. **During Maintenance and Operations**

## Web Application Security Testing

### Information Gathering Techniques
- **Search Engine Discovery:** Using search engines to find sensitive information.
- **Web Server Fingerprinting:** Identifying server types and versions.
- **Reviewing Backup and Unreferenced Files:** Detecting sensitive information in old or hidden files.
- **Enumerating Infrastructure and Admin Interfaces:** Identifying administrative endpoints.
- **Testing HTTP Methods:** 
  ```code
  4.2.6 Test HTTP Methods
  ```
- **Testing HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):**
  ```code
  4.2.7 Test HTTP Strict Transport Security
  ```
- **Testing RIA Cross Domain Policy**
- **Testing File Permissions**

### Authentication & Authorization Testing
- **Identity Management Testing:** Role definitions, user registration, account provisioning, account enumeration, username policies.
- **Authentication Testing:** Credentials transport, default credentials, lockout mechanisms, bypassing authentication, remember password vulnerabilities, browser cache weaknesses, password policies, security questions, password resets, weaker authentication.
- **Authorization Testing:** Directory traversal, bypassing authorization, privilege escalation, insecure direct object references.

### Session Management Testing
- **Session Schema Analysis**
- **Cookie Attributes:** Ensure `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags are set.
- **Session Fixation Prevention**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection**
- **Logout Functionality Verification**
- **Session Timeout Implementation**
- **Session Hijacking Prevention**

### Input Validation Testing
- **Reflected and Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **HTTP Verb Tampering**
- **HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)**
- **SQL Injection Testing for Various Databases:** Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server.

### Business Logic Testing
- **Data Validation**
- **Request Forging**
- **Integrity Checks**
- **Process Timing Assessments**
- **Function Usage Limits**

### Client-side Testing
- **DOM Manipulation**
- **Web Messaging Testing**
- **Browser Storage Testing**
- **Cross-Site Script Inclusion Testing**

### File Upload Testing
- **Validating File Types and Extensions**
- **Scanning Uploaded Files for Malicious Content**
- **Testing for Arbitrary File Execution**
- **Preventing Directory Traversal in File Uploads**

### Configuration and Deployment Management Testing
- **Reviewing Server Configurations**
- **Ensuring Secure HTTP Headers**
- **Testing for Subdomain Takeover**
- **Cloud Storage Configuration Testing**

### Error Handling Testing
- **Improper Error Message Handling**
- **Stack Trace Exposure Prevention**
- **Consistent Error Responses to Prevent Information Leakage**

### Cryptography Testing
- **Weak Transport Layer Security (TLS)**
- **Padding Oracle Vulnerabilities**
- **Encryption Strength and Key Management**
- **Secure Hashing Practices**

## Specific Vulnerability Testing

### SQL Injection
- **Types:** Inband, Out-of-band, Inferential/Blind.
- **Techniques:** UNION SELECT, Boolean Conditions, Time-based Attacks.
- **Tools:** SQLMap, wfuzz, sqlbftools.

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Types:** Reflected, Stored, DOM-based.
- **Techniques:** Script Injection, HTML Injection.
- **Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.

### LDAP Injection
- **Exploiting Search Filters:** Manipulating LDAP queries to bypass authentication.
- **Techniques:** Using metacharacters like `*`, `&`, `|`, `!`.

### XML Injection / XXE
- **Exploiting External Entities:** Accessing local files or services.
- **Techniques:** Defining external entities, injecting malicious content.
- **Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.

### Command Injection
- **Executing OS Commands:** Through unsanitized input.
- **Techniques:** Using characters like `|`, `;`, `&`.
- **Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.

### Server-Side Includes (SSI) Injection
- **Exploiting SSI directives:** Allowing remote command execution.
- **Techniques:** Injecting SSI commands like `<!--#exec cmd="OS_COMMAND"-->`.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Forcing Unintended Actions:** Exploiting authenticated sessions.
- **Techniques:** Malicious forms, hidden iframes.
- **Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.

### HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)
- **Duplicating Parameters:** To manipulate server processing.
- **Techniques:** Sending multiple parameters with the same name.
- **Tools:** wfuzz, Burp Suite.

### File Inclusion (LFI/RFI)
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Including server files.
- **Remote File Inclusion (RFI):** Including external files.
- **Techniques:** Manipulating file paths, exploiting wrappers.
- **Tools:** OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite.

### Clickjacking
- **Deceptive UI Elements:** Tricking users into unintended actions.
- **Techniques:** Using iframes, CSS masking.
- **Protection:** `X-FRAME-OPTIONS` header.

## Tools and Resources

### Testing Tools
